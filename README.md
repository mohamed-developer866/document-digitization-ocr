A comprehensive Optical Character Recognition (OCR) solution with advanced image preprocessing techniques optimized for Google Colab. This tool automatically applies multiple preprocessing methods and OCR configurations to extract text from images with maximum accuracy.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multiple Preprocessing Techniques**: 8 different image enhancement methods
- **Smart OCR Configuration**: Automatic testing of various Tesseract configurations
- **Quality Assessment**: Intelligent scoring system to select the best result
- **Visual Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of preprocessing results
- **Batch Processing Ready**: Easily extendable for multiple images
- **Colab Optimized**: Specifically designed for Google Colab environment

## 📋 Supported Image Types

- JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF
- Scanned documents
- Screenshots
- Mobile camera images
- Low-quality and noisy images

## 🛠 Installation

### For Google Colab:
```python
# The code automatically installs all dependencies:
# - Tesseract OCR
# - OpenCV
# - Pillow
# - NumPy
# - Matplotlib
This is a simple Python project that demonstrates how a physical document image can be converted into digital text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition). The project also stores the extracted text and metadata in an organized format.
